# HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

This repository contains a Power BI project for HR Analytics Dashboard. The dashboard aims to provide insights into various HR metrics such as employee attrition rate, performance ratings, salary distribution, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `HR_Data.csv`. It contains information about employees in a company including attributes like age, gender, education, job role, salary, performance ratings, etc. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Below are some of the steps and findings from the EDA process:

### Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data. Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates.

2. **Data Visualization**: Utilized various visualization techniques to explore the distribution and relationships between different variables. Histograms, bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots were used to visualize numerical and categorical variables.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted basic statistical analysis to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and other summary statistics of the numerical variables.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Derived new features if necessary and transformed existing features to make them suitable for analysis. For example, created age groups from the 'Age' variable, categorized salary levels, etc.

### Findings:

1. **Attrition Rate**: Explored the attrition rate among employees and identified factors contributing to attrition such as job satisfaction, salary, performance ratings, etc.

2. **Salary Distribution**: Analyzed the salary distribution across different departments, job roles, and experience levels. Identified any significant disparities or trends.

3. **Performance Ratings**: Investigated the relationship between performance ratings and other variables like salary, job role, education, etc. Identified high performers and areas of improvement.

4. **Employee Demographics**: Examined the demographic characteristics of employees including age distribution, gender ratio, education levels, etc.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard was developed based on the insights gained from the EDA process. It provides interactive visualizations and allows users to explore HR metrics dynamically.

### Features:

1. **Attrition Analysis**: Visualizes attrition rate trends, identifies key factors contributing to attrition, and provides insights for retention strategies.

2. **Salary Insights**: Analyzes salary distribution, compares salaries across departments and job roles, and provides insights for salary adjustments and incentives.

3. **Performance Overview**: Displays performance ratings distribution, identifies high performers, and explores factors influencing performance.

4. **Employee Demographics**: Presents demographic insights including age distribution, gender diversity, education levels, etc.

5. **Custom Filters and Interactivity**: Users can apply custom filters, drill down into specific departments or job roles, and interact with the dashboard to gain deeper insights.

### Usage:

1. Download and open the Power BI project file (.pbix) using Power BI Desktop.
2. Interact with the dashboard by applying filters, exploring different visualizations, and gaining insights into HR metrics.
